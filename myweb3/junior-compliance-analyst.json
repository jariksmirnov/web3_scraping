    "description": "At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn\u2019t do this without hiring the best people. We\u2019re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they\u2019re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That\u2019s us.</p>\n\u00a0</p>\nThere are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture.
