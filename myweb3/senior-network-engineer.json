    "description": "At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn\u2019t do this without hiring the best people. We\u2019re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they\u2019re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That\u2019s us.</p>\n\u00a0</p>\nThere are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We\u2019re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.</p>\nReady to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:</h3>\n\nYou\u2019ve got positive energy.

You\u2019re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.</li>\nYou can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You\u2019re not looking for a boring job.</li>\nYou have a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn\u2019t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.</li>\nYou want to be part of a winning team.
