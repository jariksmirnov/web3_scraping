            OpenDollar by Keyp is a new over-collateralized stablecoin protocol that is more flexible, built on top of Liquid Staking Derivatives. As more types of assets are tokenized they become more powerful when we can borrow against them at stable rates, protecting users from inflation, market instability, and liquidity limits. Our goal is to make crypto safer and more powerful for everyone by building a secure product and a trustworthy reputable brand. We are a US based team and operate within the legal and regulated framework of the law.
