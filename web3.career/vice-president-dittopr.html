           We are a results-focused team, which requires us to be experts in our clients’ industries and bring creative leadership on big plans and smart ideas that deliver impactful outputs.

           At Ditto, we work hard, fast and smart. We cover social strategy, content development, influencer management, messaging, media training, media relations, events and conferences, crisis support, and more. While we collaborate to talk through issues and come up with new ideas, plans and strategies, employees at Ditto also maintain a high-level of personal responsibility. This means each team member at Ditto understands their role and responsibilities, expectations on accounts and how to accomplish the work expected of them.

           At Ditto, we start with a very simple philosophy on accounts: As the senior lead on the account, you should be doing the senior lead work. You are responsible for the success of accounts and a positive work experience for your teams. You deliver strategic and tactical results, see the bigger picture, and form strong client relationships. You spend time meeting, motivating and helping others.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
           You are selflessly motivational, patient, always available to provide feedback but also set boundaries to ensure roles are maintained.
